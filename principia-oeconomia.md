# Foundational Essays

## Material Needs can no longer support the economy

#### There is not enough work required to support the world's material needs to supply all of the world's jobs.
Why now? And, why never before now?

> Before the Industrial Revolution, between 80 percent and 90 percent of the worldâ€™s population worked in agriculture. - (Source)

![Growing Gap](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSSadDEQ-3H2d4iW_kKwvlCwvuKs5sXjyVkeVy1dtmrI66BgOuD2DQx7Q_jf2UZyMZUn0sUXCHqbR6L/pub?w=1440&h=1080 =100%x)

As technology improves we require fewer and fewer workers to meet the global material needs of the population. Population growth is exponential and so worsens at an increasing rate. As the gap grows:


 - More people are fighting for fewer jobs resulting in higher competition and lower wages.
 - Tensions increase as people are unable to find work to sufficiently support their needs.
 - The future is global destabilization and depopulation if this gap is not remedied.




#### Material Needs vs. Immaterial needs.

Material needs are those related to physical survival and well-being, while immaterial needs are related to psychological and emotional fulfillment.

Work to meet the non-material needs of a population is not well understood and in most cases takes even fewer people. (e.g. How many people did it take to write The Lord of the Rings compared to how many people have read it?)



|           | Material Needs                                                                                                         | Immaterial Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Historically, as jobs have been lost in one sector the answer given by economists is for populations to move where jobs still needed. For example, the move from the South to the Midwest to work in factories in the 20th century. Unfortunately, we are running out of places and job sectors to move to.

> In the United States, the manufacturing sector employed just 15 percent of the workforce in 1880. Manufacturing employment peaked at 38 percent in 1944. By 2019, it fell to 8.5 percent. - (Source)

Potential Solutions

1. We can let people die out until we reach an equiliribum.
2. Create [fake jobs](#fake-jobs) 
3. Pay people to live, support population growth, and grow economic opportunities for all.

We need a better system to support future growth and future improvements to technology. Luckily it has never been easier to meet the material needs of a population than today. Due to the increase of productivity from technology (the number of people required to meet the sum of all the population's needs.)

> How many work days does it take to feed 1,000,000 people? Every year, less and less. If you look at the number of people required to grow the grain required to make bread to feed 1,000,000 people. It was 100,000s before the industrial revolution and now dozens thanks to mass farming technologies and automation.


We are at a unique turning point in history, post-material needs, where guaranteed income for the majority can be provided through the economic output of the [productive](#productivity) minority.


## Inherent Economic Value of Everyone.

#### Economy is limited by the size of the population.

#### Duel Value = (Individual Needs + Freedom).

## Who doesn't like a Meritocracy.

## Crime is a Tax on the Economy.



# Supported Policies

## 11 Negative Income Tax
A guaranteed minimum income above the poverty line, equal for all nationwide, paid directly into participants' accounts. For every dollar earned while receiving NIT individuals will keep 60% until no support is provided. This results in tapering off assistance gradually and rewards individuals who through diligence find any additional income sources.


#### Defining Principles
- Support who needs it when they need it -- not higher income earners.
- Paid out when you are paid (monthly/biweekly/etc) or bi weekly if unemployed/self-employed.
- Incentivise all who can make more income to make more income.
- Smooth transition out of assistance.
- The majority of what you make you keep (60/40 rule)
- No change in benefits if married or living together. (Calculated using married income levels / 2)
- Benefits are calculated individually based on [income](#income) and paid out individually, even in the case of marriage or cohabitation.

#### 11.1 Beyond Self-Care
For individuals who are unable to care for themselves or live independently for any reason. Care providers may receive participants' NIT to care for them on their behalf.  

- Including mental health, physical or mental disability, substance abuse etc...

#### 11.2 Prison or Jail

While in prison or jail, participants receive no NIT. The incarcerating facility may receive the individual's NIT to care for the participant on their behalf.


#### 11.3 Requirements

All individuals receiving NIT must receive all income into a single bank or institution. This is to enable efficient distribution and calculation of payments directly to individuals.

The government should make no stipulation or oversight on how distributed funds should be or are spent. If someone is wholly unable to manage their finances and cannot care for themselves see `11.1`.

#### 11.4 Distribution
Distribution is on an individual basis. No one may interfere, spouse, parent, or otherwise with the receipt or control of spending received funds.

#### 11.5 Children

Parents (or Legal Gaurdian/s) receive children's NIT starting at birth until the age of 18. At the age of 14, children start to receive their benefits, increasing gradually, until fully distributed directly into the child's account.

### 12 Remove Minimum Wage
Minimum wage is not required with the adoption of NIT. Companies lose leverage against employees because they can leave at any point if they are mistreated or underpaid.

### 13 Abolish Unions
Unions serve to protect members from mistreatment by companies and establish collective bargaining against the power of corporate interests. A company's leverage is obtained through a threat against job security combined with the necessary income for people to live. 

NIT provides guaranteed income outside of employment and therefore removes corporations' leverage and power. Unions are no longer needed as people are supported directly and so can be abolished. Any dues should instead remain with the employees to do as they see fit to prevent rent-seeking behavior from redundant organizations.

### 14 No bailouts or subsidies for Corporations
Companies should live and die by their success in the market. Securing jobs is a means to secure income. When you secure income you no longer need to protect corporations. You protect the individuals directly.

- Exemptions for issues of national security, although taxes and tariffs should be preferred and ruled out before pursuing.   

## 15 Guaranteed Affordable Healthcare

Removing all costs from healthcare removes the reward for being healthy and encourages wasteful use of healthcare resources. It should cost something to receive healthcare, to encourage appropriate use, but not beyond what is affordable individually.

Cap expenditure on health care to a monthly maximum of 10% of the rolling average of expenses over a year. For example, if you made $10,000 per month over 12 months your cap would be to spend $1,000 during any given month. After $1,000 the state would step in to cover the rest of the costs.

- Private insurance can and should exist to both provide additional coverage and reduce costs for higher spenders.

#### 15.1 Requirements
All citizens enrolled are required to connect and or report all expense accounts. Including, but not limited to checking accounts, credit cards, etc...

>Requirements for companies are to report the amount spent to the government, not the contents of the spending. Only receive the minimum information required to calculate the necessary benefits.


#### 15.2 Enforcement
Individuals found to be missreporting spending are removed from the program for an exponentially increasing amount of time per previous incidence at the rate of `2^n`.  
`2^0 = 1`, `2^1 = 2`, `2^2 = 4`, etc...

## 16 Land Value Tax
Encourage [productive](#productivity) land use. Inescapable through the offshoring of accounts. The fairest and best tax on wealth and its' accumulation.

## 17 Remove Income Tax
Tax disincentivizes behavior. Incentives income, growth, and savings. Give no reason to claim or put wealth out of the country. Keep it here and keep it productive.

## 18 Two-Strike Rule for Convicted Rape

Recipients of sexual assault often face significant and long-lasting consequences, impacting their physical and mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.

> [â€œNearly 1 in 5 women (18.3%) and 1 in 71 men (1.4%) in the United States have been raped at some time in their lives, including completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, or alcohol/drug facilitated completed penetration.](https://www.nsvrc.org/statistics/statistics-depth)

We have never been more capable of proving or disproving cases of rape through medical tests, mobile location, mobile cameras, DNA, etc.

The two-strike rule gives one chance for an individual to learn their lesson and defend against the possibility of a false conviction. On the second conviction of rape or attempted rape, individuals will receive capital punishment, promptly with no possibility of release or parole.

- 18.1 Victims who are under the age of 14 are considered two strikes.




# Government

## 19 Established Fair Pay
All representatives receive  a living wage according to their state or district. Calculated as 150% of the [average annual income before taxes for two adults (1 working)](https://livingwage.mit.edu/). Recalculated as needed.


## 20 Additional financial incentives
> Elected officials are typically elected by their constituents to *do something* or *meet a need* of those constituents. This is an unbalanced incentive that results in continually adding more to budgets and projects with nothing to counterbalance. 

All representatives who find a way to save the local, state, or federal government money are entitled to receive a portion (20%) of those savings. Rewarding efforts to make processes more efficient and reduce redundancies. 

Representatives who cut too much or too deeply would lose public support is balanced with their incentive to do the will of their constituents.

## 21 Self-Contained Bills
Bills must be self-contained and voted on one by one. 

## 22 Expiring Laws
Laws after some time (25 years) are automatically retired unless at least but not limited to one representative makes a public motion to continue the law. Laws that have been retired need to be reintroduced and voted in as laws again.

## 23 All government entities are required to follow the same expectations as Public Companies established by the SEC.

If requirements are too onerous then change them for Public companies as well. It is fair to require the government to live by the rules it makes.

## 24 Term limits of 20 years
To prevent long-term entrenched political self-interest for both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The maximum time allowed served is a total of 20 years.

# Disincentivizing Predatory Behavior

Preventing individuals sufficiently motivated to pursuing potentially self-destructive behavior is impossible without total restriction of their freedom.

Instead, what is possible and preferable is to prevent groups from taking advantage of those individuals through unfair and predatory practices.

## 25 Provably Fair Gambling

All online or computerized gambling must be proven by the provider to be fair with mathematical and irrefutable certainty. This is possible with but not limited to using zero knowledge proofs and cryptography to verify the fairness of the entries and the results of gambling.

## 26 Sports Betting

> Betting on the outcomes of sports or any other real world outcomes. 

All companies that facilitate this behavior (through betting pools, prediction markets, or otherwise) may not refuse service to any individual unless they are under 21 years of age. This prevents companies from selecting players in order to gain an unfair advantage (e.g., by banning players who perform well). Individuals under 21 must be banned from participating.

## 27 Decriminalize Sex Work

Any victims of sexual assault should be free and feel free to immediately go to authorities without worrying about consequences from the law.


## 28 Decriminalize possession and consumption of Drugs

Individuals suffering from drug addiction should be encouraged to seek help and not be pushed into isolation due to fear of legal repercussions surrounding their drug use. With the addition of NIT, individuals who are unable to take care of themselves should be provided with care and housing as specified above.

> Manufacturing and Selling Drugs illegally remains illegal.
